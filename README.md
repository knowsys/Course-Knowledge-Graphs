## Knowledge Graphs Lecture

This repository contains example data and source code used in [Knowledge Graphs exercises](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Knowledge_Graphs_(WS2024/25)/en)


Please note that during this course, we will use `git` and `git-lfs`. These tools can be installed in a debian-based system with the commands:
```
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install git-lfs
```
Once `git-lfs` has been installed, it is necessary to activate it in your local repository (`git lfs install`).
